# Defining Hotkeys

To intuitively make your hotkeys as resistant to different keyboard layouts as possible many keys are unsupported due to them missing in many common layouts.
As a baseline the `US ANSI 104` layout was used. Only some special keys (*Print Screen*, *Scroll Lock* and *Pause*) from this layout are excluded due to inconsistent keyboard events in the browser.

## The Hotkey Object

To further simplify the process of defining hotkeys the `Hotkey` object is a fully typed helper ensuring you only define hotkeys which are valid.

There are two types of hotkeys, `sequential` and `chordal`. Each types has its own set of rules it has to follow. With the `Hotkey` object you start by defining which type of hotkey you are going to create.

## Chord-Hotkeys

A *Chord-Hotkey* consists of one primary key and zero or more modifier keys that are getting pressed together at the same time. 

:::info Key-combinations like `Ctrl+A+B` are not possible
This is to prevent unexpected behaviour caused by lagging or the browser loosing focus and not receiving any `keyup`-events
:::

The `Hotkey` object guides you through the creation of the hotkey by allowing only unused modifiers before a primary key.

You can use as many modifier keys as you wish, but you can use each one only once per *Chord-Hotkey*. After specifying the primary key for the *Chord-Hotkey* the definition is completed and no additional keys can be added.

<CodeBlock className="language-tsx">{hotkey_chord}</CodeBlock>

:::warning Using `Key Values` can result in unexpected behaviour
When combining `Key Values` with `AlrGr` or `Ctrl+Alt` on Windows or `option` on macOS unexpected behaviour can occur. Due to browser limitation only the produced symbol of a KeyboardEvent can be obtained. Therefore key combination resulting in special characters cannot be resolved correctly.

(e.g.: `option+K` on macOS produces `∆` therefore `Hotkey.Chord.Alt.KeyK` will not work on macOS)
:::


## Sequence-Hotkeys

A *Sequence-Hotkey* consists of one or more primary keys and no modifier keys that are getting pressed after each other in a specific order. 

You can use each primary key as often as you like. To complete the definition you have to mark the sequence as ended by accessing the property `end`

:::warning Do not confuse `end` with the key `End`
