React Hotkeys
======================

A tiny, typed helper for registering global hotkeys in React. It supports both **chords** (e.g. `Shift + Alt + A`) and **key sequences** (e.g. `g` then `h`), respects platform-specific modifier keys, and cleans up registrations automatically.

Features
--------
- Chainable builders for chords and sequences with full TypeScript coverage.
- `Mod` alias mapping to `⌘` on macOS and `Ctrl` on Windows/Linux.
- Distinguish physical key `code` vs character `key` so shortcuts stay stable across layouts.
- Efficient global listener optimizing event handling

Installation
------------

```sh
npm install @selokhq/react-hotkeys
```

Quick start
-----------

```tsx
import { Hotkey, HotkeyProvider, useHotkey } from "@selokhq/react-hotkeys";

function Shortcuts() {
  // Layout-stable chord: Shift + OS-aware Mod + physical "K" key
  useHotkey(Hotkey.Chord.Shift.Mod.K, () => {
    console.log("Shift+⌘+K / Shift+Ctrl+K pressed")
  });

  // Sequence: press "g" then "h"
  useHotkey(Hotkey.Sequence.KeyG.KeyH.end, () => {
    console.log("[G]o [H]ome")
 });

  return null;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <HotkeyProvider>
      <Shortcuts />
    </HotkeyProvider>
  );
}
```
